# Game Engine 2021

This is one of my assignment submission in the first semester of 3rd Year. The game engine itself was created using:

* C++
* OpenGL
* OpenAL
* SDL2
* Doxygen

In addition to this CMAKE was used to create the libraries for the game engine as well as the renderer. Below you can see the UML diagrams which have been created showing each of the classes have been created:
